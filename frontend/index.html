<!-- 
Line-by-Line Explanation of Frontend JavaScript (inside <script> tag):

1.  async function fetchHello() { ... }: 
    - This defines an asynchronous function to handle the fetch operation. 
    - async allows us to use await for promises, making the code easier to read than with .then().


2.  try { ... } catch (error) { ... }: 
    - A try-catch block is used to handle potential errors during the fetch, preventing the script
      from crashing.

3.  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/hello');: 
    - This uses the Fetch API to make a GET request to the backend endpoint.
    - fetch() returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object.
    - await pauses execution until the promise resolves.

4.  The URL is hardcoded to the local backend for now (we'll update this later for deployment).

5.  if (!response.ok) { throw new Error('Network response was not ok'); }: 
    - This Checks if the HTTP status is in the 200-299 range (success). If not, throws 
      an error to jump to the catch block.

6.  const data = await response.text();: 
    - This tells Browser to parse the response body as plain text (since our backend sends 
      an HTML string, not JSON). 
    - await waits for the parsing.

7.  - document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = data;: 
      This finds the <div id="content"> element in the HTML and sets its innerHTML to the 
      fetched string, rendering <h1>Hello World</h1> on the page.

8.  console.error('Fetch error:', error);: 
    - In the catch block, this logs any errors to the browser console for debugging.

9.  window.onload = fetchHello;: 
    - This attaches the fetchHello function to the window's onload event, so it runs automatically 
      when the page finishes loading.

(A): To Run This Frontend: 

    - With the backend running, open frontend/index.html in a browser (e.g., via file:// or a local 
      server like Live Server in VS Code). It should fetch and display "Hello World" inside the div.


(B):  Running the Full Project

1.  Start the backend: 

    - cd backend
    - At the terminal prompt, type:
      
      node server.js


2.  Open frontend/index.html in a browser.

3.  You should see "Frontend Page" followed by the fetched "Hello World".

This is a complete, runnable frontend-backend system. No CSS yet, as we're keeping it simple.
